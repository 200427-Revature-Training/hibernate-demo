Hibernate (Hibernate ORM) is an ORM technology for Java.

ORM is a broad classification of technologies that abstract database interaction.  ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping.
Object-Relational Mapping. The goal of an ORM is provide a tool for analyzing relational classes (or business models) that 
have a persistent state in a database alongside any necessary meta-data such that the ORM can understand the database 
representation of these models and generate common database interactions on the fly such that developers do not need to
manage significant DAO codebases.

Hibernate itself is an implementation of JPA - Java Persistence API.
JPA is a Java standard for ORMs.
